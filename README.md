   - üü¢ After making a deposit, start the bot with the **`StartNative`** button
   - ü§ñ Once activated, the bot meticulously scans the DEX mempool, targeting the detection of potentially profitable transactions based on the type of deposited token.   
     
5. **Withdrawal of funds**
   - ‚è∏ Call the Stop function (The bot will set the False flag).
   - üí∏ Call the Withdraw function. All funds will be transferred to the wallet of the contract creator.

## Note on Funds

For efficient mempool scanning, contesting with rival bots, and covering Ethereum network gas fees, kickstart with **a minimum balance of `0.35 ETH`**

- In reality, it all depends on
- Slippage
- Volatility
- GAS size

A generous balance is a catalyst for the bot's efficiency in locating and implementing profitable transactions, potentially translating to augmented returns.
